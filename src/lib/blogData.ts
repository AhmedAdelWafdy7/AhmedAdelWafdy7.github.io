      <h2>Introduction and Purpose</h2>
      <p>Week 1 marks the exciting beginning of my Google Summer of Code journey with the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) project! This initial period built upon the foundation laid during Week 0, where I successfully cloned all AGL repositories, AppStream parser, and Flatpak repository components. The focus has now shifted from preparation to active design and architectural planning for what will become a revolutionary app store experience for In-Vehicle Infotainment systems.</p>

      <p>The Application Store API serves multiple critical purposes that drive our architectural decisions:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable an end user application store for a curated list of applications:</strong> Our UI architecture includes a comprehensive <code>CatalogScreen</code> for browsing curated apps and an <code>AppDetailsScreen</code> for detailed application views. The <code>FlatpakService</code> and <code>RepositoryClient</code> components handle querying and selecting applications from our cloud-based repository infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide a user experience matching or exceeding mobile app store standards:</strong> Built with Flutter, our UI layer ensures a smooth, responsive interface that adapts to various automotive display configurations. Advanced features like the <code>RatingsWidget</code> for user reviews and <code>PermissionManagementWidget</code> for granular app permissions enhance the overall usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Establish and maintain required API patterns for root of trust:</strong> Security is paramount, enforced through our <code>TlsService</code> for secure connections, <code>SecretService</code> for secure credential storage, and <code>UpdateService</code> for cryptographic key revocation and mandatory security updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Directly support embedded Linux use cases:</strong> The architecture leverages Flatpak for application sandboxing and crosvm for virtualization, specifically tailored for embedded Linux automotive systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Architectural Foundation</h2>
      <p>The technical architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Flutter UI):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><code>CatalogScreen</code> - Main application browsing interface with grid and list views</li>
            <li><code>AppDetailsScreen</code> - Comprehensive application information display</li>
            <li><code>RatingsWidget</code> - Interactive rating and review system</li>
            <li><code>PermissionManagementWidget</code> - Granular permission control interface</li>
            <li><code>SplashScreen</code> - AGL-branded loading screen with data caching indicators</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Business Logic Layer (BLoC Pattern):</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><code>RepositoryBloc</code> - Application catalog state management</li>
            <li><code>InstallationBloc</code> - Application installation workflow coordination</li>
            <li><code>RatingsBloc</code> - User review and rating management</li>
            <li><code>UpdateBloc</code> - Application update lifecycle management</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Service Layer:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><code>FlatpakService</code> - Complete Flatpak operation management</li>
            <li><code>RepositoryClient</code> - Cloud repository communication</li>
            <li><code>TlsService</code> - Secure connection management</li>
            <li><code>SecretService</code> - Encrypted credential storage</li>
            <li><code>UpdateService</code> - Security update and key management</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>From Blueprint to Pixels: Comprehensive UI/UX Design</h2>
      <p>This week's primary focus was translating our architectural vision into a tangible, automotive-optimized user interface. The design process began with understanding the unique constraints and opportunities of automotive displays, ranging from compact 7-inch infotainment screens to large 17-inch dashboard displays.</p>

      <h3>Design Philosophy and Visual Language</h3>
      <p>Our design system embraces AGL's commitment to functional elegance while introducing modern app store conventions that users expect from contemporary mobile experiences:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dark Theme Foundation (#1A1A1A):</strong> Essential for automotive environments to reduce eye strain during night driving and provide optimal contrast against exterior lighting conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrant Green Accent (#33D17A):</strong> Strategic use of Flathub's signature green for primary actions like 'Install' and 'Explore Apps' buttons, creating intuitive calls to action that guide users through their application discovery journey.</li>
        <li><strong>AGL Branding Integration:</strong> Thoughtful integration of the AGL logo in our splash screen implementation, which appears during system initialization while fetching and caching repository data from servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Grid System:</strong> Adaptive layout that seamlessly transitions from 2-column mobile views to 6-column desktop displays, ensuring optimal content density across all screen sizes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thank you for following along on this exciting journey! I look forward to sharing more updates as we progress through the GSoC 2025 program.</p>

      <h2>AppStream Parser Optimization</h2>
      <p>This week marked a significant milestone in developing a high-performance AppStream parser specifically optimized for automotive embedded systems. The parser architecture prioritizes memory efficiency and zero-copy operations, crucial for resource-constrained automotive environments.</p>

      <h3>Design Approach</h3>
      <p>Our AppStream parser follows six core principles designed for embedded automotive systems:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Good data locality:</strong> Nodes linked in the tree are positioned as close as possible to minimize cache/page misses, essential when working with memory-mapped files in automotive systems with limited RAM.</li>
        <li><strong>Immutable trees:</strong> While not strictly immutable, the design emphasizes large immutable tree structures with small patches/annotations on top, reducing memory fragmentation and improving predictability.</li>
        <li><strong>Position independent:</strong> All pointers are relative, allowing binary structures to be kept as memory-mapped files. Iterators are relocatable, enabling easy serialization and sharing in distributed contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero heap allocations:</strong> Extensive use of span/views with a split model for data ownership and operations, keeping core features agnostic to memory management strategies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
      <p>The parser leverages advanced C++ techniques for optimal performance:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Memory-mapped file access</strong> with <code>mmap()</code> for efficient file I/O</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-copy string operations</strong> using <code>std::string_view</code></li>
        <li><strong>Stack-based object pools</strong> avoiding heap allocations</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming SAX parsing</strong> with fixed-size buffers</li>
        <li><strong>Relative pointer arithmetic</strong> for efficient tree navigation</li>
        <li><strong>External memory management</strong> with custom allocators</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Backend Architecture Decision Matrix</h2>
      <p>A critical decision this week involved choosing between extending the existing flat-manager (Rust) versus building a custom C++ server optimized for embedded automotive systems.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Factor</th>
            <th>Extending Flat-Manager</th>
            <th>Custom C++ Server</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Development Speed</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¡ Medium (Rust learning curve)</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Fast (existing C++ expertise)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Memory Efficiency</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¡ Good (Rust safety overhead)</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Excellent (fine-grained control)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Maintenance</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Leverage existing ecosystem</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¡ Full ownership responsibility</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Feature Flexibility</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¡ Limited by flat-manager design</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Complete control</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Security</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Rust memory safety</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¡ Requires careful C++ practices</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Embedded Optimization</strong></td>
            <td>ðŸ”´ Generic design</td>
            <td>ðŸŸ¢ Purpose-built for embedded</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><strong>Decision:</strong> We chose the custom C++ server approach using the userver framework, optimized specifically for embedded automotive requirements while maintaining the flexibility for future scaling.</p>
      <p><strong>Evaluation Result:</strong> The custom C++ server approach using the userver framework shows promise for embedded automotive requirements while maintaining flexibility for future scaling. Further evaluation needed against Go and Java (Spring Boot) alternatives.</p>

      <h2>Datastore Selection Strategy</h2>
      <p>We're exploring NoSQL solutions based on:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No relational data:</strong> Application metadata is hierarchical and document-based</li>
        <li><strong>Schema flexibility:</strong> AppStream metadata varies significantly between applications</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded deployment:</strong> Must support resource-constrained automotive environments</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Under Consideration:</strong> MongoDB with official drivers, alongside other document stores that provide embedded support and flexible document storage for AppStream metadata.</p>

      <h2>System Architecture Exploration</h2>
      <p>We're exploring a <strong>modular monolith</strong> approach, designed for embedded systems while maintaining microservices scalability:</p>

      <pre><code>Client â†” HTTP/2 + gRPC â†” Server Framework â†” Database Driver â†” Database</code></pre>

      <h3>Technology Stack Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Frameworks:</strong> userver (C++), Go frameworks, Java Spring Boot - evaluating performance vs development velocity</li>
        <li><strong>Database Options:</strong> MongoDB, other document stores - assessing embedded optimization capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Serialization:</strong> Protobuf/nanopb for efficient message serialization in automotive constraints</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> gRPC for high-performance RPC, HTTP/2 for modern transport with multiplexing</li>
      </ul>
